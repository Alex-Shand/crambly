# One crambly file can have multiple commands
# In this case the command output must be delimited by @@@@@@
# Output binds to the nearest preceeding command by default

$ echo "Hello"

@@@@@@
Hello
@@@@@@

$ echo "Goodbye"

@@@@@@
Goodbye
@@@@@@

# If a command has no output following it crambly will assert that the command
# produces no output
# Commands run in order in the same shell session so one command can export
# variables used by another

$ export MY_VAR='Export!'
# This is not a continuation, it's a separate command
$ echo "$MY_VAR"

# The output of the last command in the file doesn't need to be delimited

Export!
